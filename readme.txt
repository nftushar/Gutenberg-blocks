== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an OpenAI API key? =

Yes, for the AI-powered features (AI FAQ and Ai Product Recommendations), you will need to provide your own OpenAI API key in the block's settings panel in the editor.

= Is WooCommerce required? =

WooCommerce is only required for the blocks that interact with products, such as the Product Slider and Ai Product Recommendations. Other blocks will work without it.

= Can I customize the look and feel? =

Yes! Most blocks come with built-in styling options, such as light/dark themes and different layouts (grid, list, slider).
